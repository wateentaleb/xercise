A visual representation of the movement performed versus an ideal movement when performing the exercise is shown on the cross-platform mobile application, which is ultimately determined by using a machine learning algorithm and known are visually shown to the user and, the user gets their workout sessions logged, with the name of the exercises performed, the repetitions performed on each set. 
 
Unfortunately, **over a third of the Canadian population gets injured whilst performing sport or exercises**. Which is twice as high as the workplace injuries and seven times higher than the number of senior injuries.
